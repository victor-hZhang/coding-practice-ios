MVVM with RXSwift

I had fun doing both of this challanges, 
it's nice to refreash the basics every now and then,
Tried to use a differnt type for IOS and Android (MVVM-RXSwift and MVP).
unfortunately I was sick over the weekend so if you ever wonder why IOS code is a bit "rude".
It's because I'm physically unwell and kind of rushing to get it done.

Anyway, enough excuses, have fun playing around, any feedback or improvements welcome, 
just open up a pull request.
